# Rego Style Guide

The purpose of this style guide is to provide a collection of recommendations
and best practices for authoring
[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).
From [Styra](https://www.styra.com), the founders of
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA),
and some of the most experienced members of the community,
we hope to share lessons learnt from authoring and reviewing hundreds of
thousands of lines of Rego over the years.
